A strand is similar to a post in other websites such as reddit.
A strand can contain an image, some text, or both.
Other users can post comments to strands. 
Users can "pin" strands within a group. The pinned strands can be found in a separate "pinned" tab in the group view.
The group view will now show a list of strand cards, where images are shown as thumbnails, and pure text strand are shown as text cards. 
A user has the ability to edit a strand after it is created.
