# Cursor Workspace Rules

## Mobile Compatibility Requirement
- **ALL features MUST be compatible with both iOS and Android devices**
- When implementing new features, always consider iOS Safari and Android Chrome limitations
- Test features on both platforms before considering them complete
- Use platform detection when platform-specific code is needed
- See `MOBILE_COMPATIBILITY_RULES.md` for detailed guidelines and implementation patterns

## Testing Requirement
- All components and modules MUST have tests that check their basic functions
- Tests run automatically on every build
- See `TESTING_RULES.md` for detailed testing guidelines

## Code Quality
- Always push changes to git if a remote has been set up
- Check that the project builds and runs without errors
- Always create tests for components that check all exposed APIs and basic functionality
